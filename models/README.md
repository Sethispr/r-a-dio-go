This package has the data structs used to map json from the r-a-d.io api

* **Song:** Includes the ID and a flag to see if the song is actually allowed to be requested
* **RadioStatus / MainStream:** See current listeners and what is playing
* **DJ:** Whoever is doing dj (see note below)
* **Track:** Show queue, also shows if the song is requested by a user or an auto chosen song by clanker

> [!NOTE]
> If **hanyuu-sama** is dj you can send requests, but you cant send reqs when a real person dj is on
